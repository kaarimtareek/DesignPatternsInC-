## Mediator

### When to use mediator pattern?

- Use the Mediator pattern when it’s hard to change some of the
  classes because they are tightly coupled to a bunch of other
  classes.
- e pattern when you can’t reuse a component in a different program because it’s too dependent on other components.
- Use the Mediator when you find yourself creating tons of component subclasses just to reuse some basic behavior in various
  contexts.

### How to implement?

1. Identify a group of tightly coupled classes which would benefit from being more independent (e.g., for easier maintenance
or simpler reuse of these classes).
2. Declare the mediator interface and describe the desired communication protocol between mediators and various components. In most cases, a single method for receiving
   notifications from components is sufficient. This interface is crucial when you want to reuse component classes in different contexts. As long as the component works with its mediator via the generic interface, you can link the
   component with a different implementation of the mediator.
3. Implement the concrete mediator class. Consider storing references to all components inside the mediator. This way, you
   could call any component from the mediator’s methods.
4. You can go even further and make the mediator responsible for
   the creation and destruction of component objects. After this,
   the mediator may resemble a factory or a facade.
5. Components should store a reference to the mediator object.
   The connection is usually established in the component’s constructor, where a mediator object is passed as an argument.
6. Change the components’ code so that they call the mediator’s
   notification method instead of methods on other components.
   Extract the code that involves calling other components into
   the mediator class. Execute this code whenever the mediator
   receives notifications from that component.
