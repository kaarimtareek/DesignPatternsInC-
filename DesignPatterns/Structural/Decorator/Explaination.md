﻿## Decorator

### When to use decorator patten?

- Use the Decorator pattern when you need to be able to assign
extra behaviors to objects at runtime without breaking the
code that uses these objects.
- Use the pattern when it’s awkward or not possible to extend
  an object’s behavior using inheritance.

### How to implement ?
1. Make sure your business domain can be represented as a primary component with multiple optional layers over it.
2. Figure out what methods are common to both the primary
   component and the optional layers. Create a component interface and declare those methods there.
3. Create a concrete component class and define the base behavior in it.
4. Create a base decorator class. It should have a field for storing
   a reference to a wrapped object. The field should be declared
   with the component interface type to allow linking to concrete
   components as well as decorators. The base decorator must
   delegate all work to the wrapped object.
5. Make sure all classes implement the component interface.
6. Create concrete decorators by extending them from the base
   decorator. A concrete decorator must execute its behavior
   before or after the call to the parent method (which always
   delegates to the wrapped object).
7. The client code must be responsible for creating decorators
   and composing them in the way the client needs.
