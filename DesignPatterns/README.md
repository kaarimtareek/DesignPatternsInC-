# Design Patterns Implementation using C#

----
This repo is based on implementing the patterns in `Dive into design patterns` book.

The design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.


The project is separated into **3 main folders,** each folder for one of design pattern categories (Creational , behavioral, structural).

- Creational patterns provides creation mechanisms that increase the flexibility & resue of existing code.
- Structural patterns explains how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and effiecnt.
- Behavioral patterns take care of effective communitcation and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
